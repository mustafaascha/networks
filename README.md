The following are notes on Douglas Luke's [A User's Guide to Network Analysis in R](https://www.amazon.com/User%E2%80%99s-Guide-Network-Analysis/dp/3319238825/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472821027). 

I'll be reviewing the parts of this book that are difficult to glean from documentation. For example, I will note the difference between an adjacency matrix and an edge list, and even some of the methods for these objects, but I won't be focusing on how to create the objects themselves.
